Steps:-
* Dropping ID column

* In 'City_Code' columns, it is of Object Data type, The values are like C3, C4 etc.
  we take only the numerical values like out of C3 we take only 3.

* Convert the 'City_Code' dtpye from object to integer.

* 'Accomodation_Type' has 2 unique values - Owned and Rented.
   Mapping Owned - 0 and Rented - 1

* 'Reco_Insurance_Typehas ' 2 unique values - Individual and Joint
   Mapping Individual - 0 and Joint- 1

* 'Is_Spouse ' has 2 unique values - No and Yes
   Mapping No - 0 and Yes - 1

* In 'Health Indicator' column, it is of Object Data type, The values are like X1, X2 etc.
  we take only the numerical values like from X1 we take only 1.

* In 'Holding_Policy_Duration' column, for all the recors having Holding_Policy_Duration as
  '14+ ' to 15

After Hyperparameter tuning
* RFC - 50%
* XGB - 54%

Try using other ML Models
Try using standard scalar
Try improving the accuracy
Try tweaking the hyperparameters
Try Clustering and Predicting
Try stacking
Try Dropping Region_code

Highest Accuracy - New Approach->Hyperparameter Tunning-> Xgb
